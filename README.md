# Cloud Native Application Architectures with Cloud Foundry

## Prework

1. Windows or Mac OSX 
2. Java JDK 1.7+ (_Required_, whether or not the .NET labs will be followed)
3. Install the PCF CLI 
    - Download from [here](https://apps.pcf12.cloud.fe.pivotal.io/tools)
4. Firefox or Chrome (Not IE)

## Smoke Test

1. Git clone (or download and unzip from Git) https://github.com/cdelashmutt-pivotal/SpringCloudWorkshop.git 
2. cd SpringCloudWorkshop/session_04/lab_07/complete/hello-actuator
3. gradlew.bat assemble ( or ./gradlew on MacOSX)
4. java -jar build/libs/hello-actuator-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
5. browse to http://localhost:8080
6. cf login -a https://api.pcf12.cloud.fe.pivotal.io --skip-ssl-validation (use student1/f1s3rv)

### Optional
 
1.  A java IDE is strongly recommended.  Eclipse, STS, or IntelliJ will provide the best experience.
2.  Visual Studio, if you plan to try any of the .NET content.
3.  ASP.NET 5 - at least one of the labs will be done using ASP.NET 5.  A completed version of this lab will be available/usable for those that don't want to install ASP.NET 5, and just want to review/push the code to Cloud Foundry.
